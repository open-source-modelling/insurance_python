def simulate_Hull_White_One_Factor(r0: float , a: float, sigma: float, t, f):
    """ Simulates a temporal series of interest rates using the One Factor Hull-White model
     Form of the model is dr_{t} = [theta[t] - alpha * r_{t-1}] dt + sigma * dW_{t} 
     interest_rate_simulation = simulate_Hull_White_One_Factor(r0, alpha, sigma, t, f)
    
     Args:
       r0 (float): starting interest rate of the Hull White process.
       a (float): speed of reversion parameter that is related to the velocity at which such trajectories will regroup around the forward rate theta.
       sigma (float): instantaneous volatility measures instant by instant the amplitude of randomness entering the system.
       t (array of floats): representing times at which the output is generated. 
       f (array of floats): representing the instantaneous forward rates at times from input t.
    
     Returns:
       N x 2 Pandas DataFrame where index is modeling time and values are a realisation of the spot rate increments.
    
     Example:
       Model the interest rate which is 2% today. The annualized instant volatility is 20%. The external analysis points out that the parameter alpha is 0.04 and the forward rates are equal to 3% in all maturities. 
       The user is interested in an interest rate projection of the next 10 years in annual time steps
