def SWCalibrate(r: np.ndarray, M: np.ndarray, ufr: float, alpha: float)-> np.ndarray:
    """
    Calculate the calibration vector using the Smith-Wilson algorithm.

    Calculates the calibration vector `b` used for interpolation and extrapolation of rates.

    Arguments:
        r: n x 1 ndarray of rates for which you wish to calibrate the algorithm. Each rate belongs to an observable zero-coupon bond with a known maturity. Example: r = np.array([[0.0024], [0.0034]])
        M: n x 1 ndarray of maturities of bonds that have rates provided in the input `r`. Example: M = np.array([[1], [3]])
        ufr: Floating number representing the ultimate forward rate. Example: ufr = 0.042
        alpha: Floating number representing the convergence speed parameter alpha. Example: alpha = 0.05

    Returns:
        n x 1 ndarray representing the calibration vector needed for interpolation and extrapolation. Example: b = np.array([[14], [-21]])
