    """Simulate a temporal series of stock prices using the Black-Scholes log-normal model and generated Brownian motion.

    Args:
        S0 (int): Initial value of the underlying asset.
        mu (float): Drift rate of the underlying asset.
        sigma (float): Standard deviation of the underlying asset's return.
        T (int): Maximum modeling time.
        dt (float): Length of each subinterval.

    Returns:
        pd.DataFrame: N x 2 DataFrame with index as modeling time and values as realizations of the underlying's price.

    Example:
        Model the price of a stock which is worth today 100. The market has a future annualized risk-free rate of 5% and an annualized volatility of 30%. The user is interested in a price projection for the next 10 years in increments of 6 months (0.5 years).
