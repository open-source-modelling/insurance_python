    🐍 Two factor Vasicek model 🐍     
  </b>
</h1>

A simple model for calculating the nominal interest rates. Used to add inflation to the simulation of interest rates. The model has two sources of randomness (Two correlated Brownian motions)

## Problem
When modelling the nominal rate, both the real rate of return and the inflation should be considered. The correlation between them means that one should use a multifactor model as opposed to two independent models. Additionally, there is a robust body of literature showing that both real rates and the inflation are mean-reverting

## Solution
The simplest model for modelling real rates and inflation together is the multifactor Vasicek model https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasicek_model. The Vasicek model is a short rate model describing the evolution of rates. Both the real rate process and the inflation rate process are assumed to follow a Vasicek model. The movement of the two curves is given by a two-dimensional correlated Brownian motion

### Input
Vasicek model simulator:
 - `r0` ... Starting annualized real rate and inflation rate. ex. if the annualized real rate is 1.4% and inflation is 6%, then r0 = [0.014, 0.06]   
 - `a` ... mean reversion speed for the real and inflation process. ex. if the reversion factor is 0.8 for real rates and 1 for inflation, a = [0.8, 1]         
 - `b` ... long term mean level for the real and inflation process. ex. if the long-term real rate is 1% and long term inflation is 1.5%, b = [0.01, 0.015]    
 - `sigma` ... instantaneous volatility of the real and inflation process. ex. volatility of the real rate process is 5% and inflation process is 4%, sigma = [0.05, 0.04] 
 - `rho` ... correlation between the stochastic noise that generates the two processess. ex. if the calculated correlation coefficient is 0.t, rho = 0.6            
 - `T` ... modelling time horizon. ex. if time horizon is 25 years, T = 25               
 - `dt` ... time increments. ex. time increments are 6 months, dt = 0.5             

Vasicek model pricing:
 - `nScen` ... integer, number of simulations of the Monte Carlo method

Vasicek model calibration:
TBD

### Output
Vasicek model simulator:
 - `interest_rate_simulation` is a pandas dataframe with one sample path generated by the model. One for the real rate process and the other for the nominal rates (real rate + inflation rate)

Vasicek model pricing:
 - Price of a Zero-Coupon Bond with maturity T based on the model. The technique used is Monte Carlo with 1000 scenarios and numeric integration

Vasicek model calibration:
TBD

## Getting started
``` python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import datetime as dtm

from Vasicek import BrownianMotion
from Pricing import ZeroCouponBond

from IPython.display import display
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Vasicek model simulator
r0 = [0.014, 0.06]   # Starting annual real rate and annual inflation rate
a = [0.8, 1]         # mean reversion speed for real rate and inflation
b = [0.01, 0.015]    # long term trend for real rate and inflation
sigma = [0.05, 0.04] # annualized volatility of real rate and inflation process
rho = 0.6            # correlation
T = 25               # time horizon
dt = 0.5             # time increment

brownian = BrownianMotion()
interest_rate_simulation = brownian.simulate_Vasicek_Two_Factor(r0, a, b, sigma, rho, T, dt)

display(interest_rate_simulation)

interest_rate_simulation.plot(figsize = (15,9), grid = True)
plt.legend()
plt.show()

# Vasicek model pricing of a Zero-Coupon Bond
nScen = 1000
zero_coupon_bond = ZeroCouponBond(1)
zero_coupon_bond.price(r0, a, b, sigma, rho, T, dt, nScen)
print(zero_coupon_bond._price)

# Calibration of the Vasicek model
# Defining a zero curve for the example
# Dates = [[2010,1,1], [2011,1,1], [2013,1,1], [2015,1,1], [2017,1,1], [2020,1,1], [2030,1,1]]
# curveDates = []
# for date in Dates:
#     curveDates.append(dtm.date(date[0],date[1],date[2]))
# 
# zeroRates = np.array([1.0, 1.9, 2.6, 3.1, 3.5, 4.0, 4.3])/100

# plt.figure(figsize = (15,9))
# plt.plot(curveDates,zeroRates)
# plt.title('Yield Curve for ' + str(curveDates[0]))
# plt.xlabel('Date')
# plt.ylabel('Rate')
# plt.show()
# STILL TO DO
